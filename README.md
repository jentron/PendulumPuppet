This started as a Java/Processing port from my adaptation of the Khan Academy Challenge: "Pendulum puppet" https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-challenge-pendulum-puppet/5766905319653376

The Java version reads the description of the puppet from json and also loads images from a data file.


It requires the Processing Java libraries to compile. See https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/
